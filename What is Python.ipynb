Let's break that down:\n","- **Interpreted**: In most cases, machine-code is not generated from the source code in advance of the instructions being carried out (this process would be called compilation). Instead, an \"interpreter\" is used to read the source code as the code is executed to find out what instructions should be carried out next. The line between \"interpreted\" and \"compiled\" languages is not absolute and is becoming increasingly blurred. Any compiled language can be interpreted and any interpreted language can be compiled and it is becoming increasingly common for modern languages, including Python, to sit somewhere between these two extremes. However, Python is still classed as an \"interpreted\" language as this is historically how it as used and is the most common way it is used today.\n","- **High-level**: Many detailed operations of the computer are hidden from the user and are not (easily) available. Instead, more general and abstracted commands are available. By contrast, low-level languages have much more direct control over the operations the computer performs. Machine-code is the lowest level language as each individual operation performed is represented. Generally, higher-level languages are slower but easier and quicker to write and read\n","- **General purpose**: Python makes no assumptions about its intended usage and contains no application specific codes by default. By contrast, some languages have an intended area of application and contain many specialised features relating to this area but may be lacking features in others. For example, \"R\" is a programming language specialised for statistical analysis.\n","- **Programming language**: A set of rules determining how source code instructions will be translated in operations inside the computer."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"KR835eFR8r14"},"source":["## Properties of Python\n","\n","- Python is one of the most commonly-used codes in the world and is popular amongst a wide range of audiences.\n","- Python has a large community:\n","  * Lots of people to ask questions of\n","  * Lots of user-created libraries\n","- Well-supported by external software such as Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).\n","- Wide range of non-core functionality.\n","  * Plotting\n","  * Unit-testing\n","  * Automatic documentation generation\n","- Python is relatively easy to learn.\n","- Python is relatively quick to write code in.\n","- Native Python is slow\n","- Better performance can be achieved using specialised modules which allow interaction with code written in lower-level languages"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Zi4vYYgSOxfC"},"source":["## Features of Python\n","\n","Python contains a number of useful features.
