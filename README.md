# Introduction to Python

## Pre-Course Instructions

### Face to Face Course Instructions

To complete this course, you will need to run Jupyter Notebook files on your computer. The easiest way to do this is to ensure you have a Google account. This will allow us to use the online Google Colab tool to run the notebooks on the day.

Alternatively, if you don’t have and don’t want to create a Google account, you may instead install Anaconda on your computer by downloading the appropriate distribution from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

The presentation and the Notebooks may be downloaded [here](https://github.com/coolernato/Introduction-to-Python/archive/ICR.zip). If you want to undertake the course on your own laptop, you may want to download them. However, you do not need to read them before attending.

## Colab Links

The following are links to the Notebooks which will open in Google Colab. To use these links, you will need to log into a Google account. Once you click the link, you may see a page saying "Connected apps". If Google Colaboratory is in the list, click it to open the notebook. If it's not, click "Connect more apps...", search for "Colab" and connect the app before selecting it.
